# Rational expectations storage model expressed in a way that allows
# it to be solved by fixed-point iteration like in Deaton and Laroque

declarations:

  states: [A]

  controls: [S, P]

  expectations: [EP]

  shocks: [e]

  parameters: [k, delta, r, a, b]


equations:

  arbitrage:

    - A-(EP*(1-delta)/(1+r)-k-a)/b  |     0 <= S <= inf
    - EP*(1-delta)/(1+r)-k          | a+b*A <= P <= inf

  transition:

    - A = (1-delta)*S(-1)+e

  expectation:

    - EP  = P(1)
